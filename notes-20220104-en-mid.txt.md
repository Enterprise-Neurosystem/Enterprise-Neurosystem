# Discussion kickoff - Secure AI Fabric - 1/4/22

## Security of models
- Some environments will not allow even the shared models (military)
  - Though it could be done entirely inside the military domain, may not be the primary use case
  - Also banking is OK with shared models as long as data is not shared -- better use case
- Need policies around who can use models
  - Need definitions of use cases as to where this approach applies
  - Not being all things to all people

## Shared catalog model usefulness
- Foundational model
  - Convert foundational model into usable model for each domain (templating)
  - Not necessary to have compositional model

## Metamesh
- Need to have more slides leading up to it
- Application registration, default visibility
- Administration to increase visibility of data
- Perhaps terminology implies more than it really is

## Next steps
- Set up discussion on shared catalog and go into more details
